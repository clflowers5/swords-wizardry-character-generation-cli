# Swords & Wizardry Character Generation CLI

Made as a small boredom project using TypeScript and Inquirer and other things.

## Features
* Supports selection or random generation of all major character traits (Race, Sex, Class, Name)
* Supports random stat generation (Good for short term NPCs or random encounter characters)
* Writes generated characters to YAML files in the `./characters` directory.

## Usage
```npm start```

```yarn start```

And be amazed.

## Tests
There are none. You are the test.


## Glorified todo list:

* ~~Save to file~~
* Character Stats
    * User-input stats  (Do I want this?)
    * ~~Generation~~
* House Rules support
    * Config based / strategy applied
      * Primarily concerned with stat generation and class selection
* ~~Valid Character flag~~ (not needed)
    * ~~errors messages / notices~~
